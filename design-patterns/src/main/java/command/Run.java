 * We cannot change our past, but frequently we wish we could do so.
 * Unfortunately, we do not have any such device yet to fulfill that wish. But
 * we can undo and redo many other operations in our daily life. We can erase a
 * pencil drawing with a rubber. We can re-architect our living places. And,
 * most important, we can forget bad memories and start a fresh journey. So, you
 * must acknowledge that undo/redo operations are part of our life and we are
 * doing those through some commandsâ€”either externally or internally.
