/**
 * Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
 * The adapter pattern lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise
 * because of incompatible interfaces.
 * 
 * The most common example of this type can be found with mobile charging
 * devices. If our charger is not supported by a particular kind of switchboard,
 * we need to use an adapter. Even the translator who is translating language
 * for one person is following this pattern in real life.
