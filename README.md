# design-patterns

Just a simple project that contains (not yet) all design patterns.

It's a Maven project built with Java.

Each package represents a specific design pattern and contains a class called Run that 
you can execute in order to demonstrate the example.

Patterns that are completed:
- adapter
- command
- decorator
- observer
- proxy
- singleton
- strategy policy
- template method

Any contribution is more than welcomed!
